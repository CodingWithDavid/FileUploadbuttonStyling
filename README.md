## Why

I came across an article on how to style the file upload button and I waited to apply it to my Blazor application.  Turns out it is very easy.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/FileUploadbuttonStyling
   cd FileUploadbuttonStyling
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
b.  With Visual Code you will need to install the Blazor extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

New CSS that selects the input file button and applies style:

input[type=file]::file-selector-button

From here, you can apply any style you would like.
